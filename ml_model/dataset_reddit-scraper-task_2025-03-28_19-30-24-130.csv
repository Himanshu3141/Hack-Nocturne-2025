"I'm sure many people here would have seen the new [4o image generation model](https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/) that OpenAI shipped a couple of days ago. It's very impressive! People are actually excited to play with generative AI again (or they just want to see what their family photos look like in a Studio Ghibli style). OpenAI really simplified the process of generating high quality images in a variety of art styles. I feel like this is what GenMoji should have been.

GenMoji, in my opinion, turned out to be hardly any better than AI slop—generic, low-quality, and just plain ugly in many cases. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s new model can generate incredibly accurate images from a text conversation, without having to give it long paragraphs of prompting. And if it does make a mistake, you can point it out and it will just fix it without completely messing up the rest of the image (which is a common issue with many existing models).

I know Apple's having a hard time with AI right now—and this will probably get rolled into some future version of Apple Intelligence—but every week it feels like Apple is falling years behind.",,,,"r/apple","2025-03-27T18:54:22.000Z","post",,,"Apple Intelligence ",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure many people here would have seen the new &lt;a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/""&gt;4o image generation model&lt;/a&gt; that OpenAI shipped a couple of days ago.

Please can someone help me, I got an Apple Watch and set the whole thing up then I tried to go on privacy and security setting and it asked for my screen time password, which I thought was weird, I then typed in my usual password, which said it was wrong. So then I went onto my phone to try and change the password to see if it’ll change on my watch as well, bear in mind I used that same password I typed into the watch to change the password which worked. Then when changing the password didn’t affect the Apple Watch I tried just turning screen time off on my phone, which you need to type in your screen time password, so I did that and successfully turned it off. Then that didn’t help my Apple Watch so I tried to turn screen time back on, on my phone and it asked for my screen time passcode to turn it back in, which I then typed in and it’s telling me it’s wrong even though I just used it to turn screen time off. I tried my old password as well which didn’t work either. It seems like whatever password the watch has stored, also made that the password on my phone and now I can’t do anything to any of them with regard to screen time. And there’s no forgot password button either, what am I supposed to do, am I locked out of this section of my phone forever?",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-28T17:59:14.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please can someone help me, I got an Apple Watch and set the whole thing up then I tried to go on privacy and security setting and it asked for my screen time password, which I thought was weird, I then typed in my usual password, which said it was wrong.

"Its time to upgrade my laptop as I get ready for grad school. I work from home as Talent Director for a government contractor (and yes I use my own laptop), and this will be used on school work.

"From the article: Apple today announced new initiatives in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand that collaborate with communities to advance technology’s role in preserving culture and enhancing education. This includes rolling out representation of Indigenous lands in Australia and New Zealand in Apple Maps, unveiling new community grants for local partners, and expanding the Apple Foundation Program to help students pursue careers in the growing iOS app economy.

“We’ve had teams in Australia and New Zealand for over 40 years, and we’re thrilled to deepen our relationships here and bring new opportunities to communities across both countries,” said Alisha Johnson Wilder, Apple’s senior director of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “These efforts put community first by representing Indigenous land, expanding access to education, and protecting our shared environment.”

Beginning today, Apple Maps now displays Indigenous lands in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. By gathering information from Indigenous advisors, cartographers, Traditional Owners, language holders, and community members, Apple Maps will show reserves and Indigenous Protected Areas, Indigenous place names, Traditional Country, and dual-language labels. Indigenous lands place cards feature information about the local area and Traditional Owners, and can be curated to allow communities to add their own photos, destinations on their land, and text in their own language.

This includes rolling out representation of Indigenous lands in Australia and New Zealand in Apple Maps, unveiling new community grants for local partners, and expanding the Apple Foundation Program to help students pursue careers in the growing iOS app economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had teams in Australia and New Zealand for over 40 years, and we’re thrilled to deepen our relationships here and bring new opportunities to communities across both countries,” said Alisha Johnson Wilder, Apple’s senior director of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “These efforts put community first by representing Indigenous land, expanding access to education, and protecting our shared environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning today, Apple Maps now displays Indigenous lands in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. By gathering information from Indigenous advisors, cartographers, Traditional Owners, language holders, and community members, Apple Maps will show reserves and Indigenous Protected Areas, Indigenous place names, Traditional Country, and dual-language labels. Indigenous lands place cards feature information about the local area and Traditional Owners, and can be curated to allow communities to add their own photos, destinations on their land, and text in their own language.

"From the article: Apple's custom silicon chips will begin to be manufactured in the United States at an accelerated pace as TSMC adjusts its timelines, although the chips produced domestically will be limited to older models for the foreseeable future, [Nikkei Asia](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Tech-Asia/TSMC-s-165bn-U.S.-expansion-push-Inevitable-but-risky) reports.

Exclusive Apple chip supplier TSMC has confirmed that future fabrication facilities in the United States will be brought online more quickly than its first Arizona-based plant, which was beset by delays. TSMC now expects new U.S. plants to take no more than two years to complete, a significant improvement over the five-year timeline required for its initial facility. Despite the expedited pace, the chips produced in these new plants will not power Apple's latest models, as the most advanced fabrication processes will remain exclusive to TSMC's operations in Taiwan.

The company's first U.S. plant, located in Phoenix, Arizona, began construction in 2020 and is expected to begin production in 2025. This facility is configured to produce chips using TSMC's N4 process, which is part of the broader 5-nanometer node family. This generation includes the A16 Bionic chip, originally introduced in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Pro and later used in the iPhone 15, ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, and the latest entry-level iPad. The S9 chip used in the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is also an N4 chip. These chips are no longer at the top of Apple's product line technologically and their production today simply supports continued manufacturing of the company's older or lower-end models.

TSMC has announced plans for a second Arizona plant that will support production of 3-nanometer chips, currently the most advanced node in mass production and used for chips like the A17 Pro, M3, A18, and M4. However, this second facility will not begin operations until 2028, at which point Apple's mainstream devices will likely have moved to 2-nanometer or more advanced silicon.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-27T16:39:29.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the article: Apple&amp;#39;s custom silicon chips will begin to be manufactured in the United States at an accelerated pace as TSMC adjusts its timelines, although the chips produced domestically will be limited to older models for the foreseeable future, &lt;a href=""https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Tech-Asia/TSMC-s-165bn-U.S.-expansion-push-Inevitable-but-risky""&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

"My first bit of advice anyone who gets an apple device for their elderly family members make sure that you add yourself as a trusted phone number, recovery, contact, and legacy contact, especially if they’re old. Make sure that you know their passcode. Make sure that you know their password set all of this information up and you will not have to worry about losing your Apple account. So many people are so dumb they don’t know how to manage their Apple devices and then get mad at Apple. I was in the Apple Store and watch like 10 people come in because they’re like I forgot my passcode but then they also don’t know their password and then also I’ve changed their number and then can’t reset their password because they have no number to send the verification code cause they only had one trusted number pull it together people otherwise have a flip phone",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-27T17:31:06.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first bit of advice anyone who gets an apple device for their elderly family members make sure that you add yourself as a trusted phone number, recovery, contact, and legacy contact, especially if they’re old.

"From the article:
&gt;Apple today announced the official release date of its iPhone 16 lineup in Indonesia, after the country lifted a ban on its sale following Apple's more than $300 million investment plan. The iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and iPhone 16e will launch in the Indonesian market on April 11.

&gt;The announcement indicates that the iPhone 16 series has passed the Indonesian telecommunications equipment certification – the final hurdle in the approvals process. Previously, the iPhone 16 models also obtained the local component content (TKDN) certification issued by the Indonesian Ministry of Industry, with a standard rate of 40%, exceeding the current minimum requirement of 35%.

&gt;Indonesia blocked iPhone 16 sales in October after determining that Apple had not met the country's 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones.

&gt;Beyond the monetary investment, Apple has reportedly committed to training local talent in research and development, so that Indonesians can develop software and design their own products. The pledge addresses one of the government's key demands for Apple to establish R&amp;D facilities in the country.

&gt;The agreement also includes plans for a manufacturing plant on Batam island that will produce AirTags, Apple's device tracking accessories. This facility will be operated by Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry, and is expected to eventually account for 20% of global AirTag production.

&gt;Another manufacturing facility is planned for Bandung, about three hours from Jakarta, which will produce other types of accessories. Part of the investment will also fund Apple academies to equip Indonesian students with tech skills like coding.

&gt;Despite the substantial concessions, recent reports indicate that Apple has no immediate plans to manufacture iPhones in Indonesia. That means Apple remains the only brand in the country allowed to sell imported smartphones without local manufacturing. In contrast, other manufacturers must comply with TKDN regulations by producing devices locally or contributing through software development.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-26T16:35:35.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;/p&gt;

"There’s some small benefit to having everything on the internal drive. Some stuff writes to the internal by default and if you run 256GB drive for your OS and everything else external it can cause some headaches, even if they have solutions.

For example in Final Cut Pro it’ll build your cache layers and save them to disk. This can actually be 100GB file saved to disk, and if you run out things start breaking in your video editing workflow.

So you gotta Google and figure out how to change the default storage location, which you totally can and it’s not a big deal, but it’s a headache you have to solve.

Also, once I lost my external 2TB data drive and for 3 months I couldn’t work on my video projects until I found it randomly in my suitcase pocket.

"&gt; For example in Final Cut Pro it’ll build your cache layers and save them to disk.

You can put them on an external drive, though.

&gt; So you gotta Google and figure out how to change the default storage location, which you totally can and it’s not a big deal, but it’s a headache you have to solve

Oh, um. If you're getting headaches from changing a setting I don't know what to say. You're going to have to figure things out and do stuff with the computer in order to have it do useful work for you...

&gt; Also, once I lost my external 2TB data drive and for 3 months I couldn’t work on my video projects until I found it randomly in my suitcase pocket.

That's why you have backup.

"Hello, this is probably going to be a long post but I have been experiencing weird problems with my data for the past two iPhones I had, (12 and 14). I have T-mobile and I brought this up to them and they said they are not sure what is happening and that this is an Apple problem but I want to see if anyone has had this problem before.

Basically, when I am on my data/LTE, only CERTAIN apps/functions work. The apps and functions that work depend on the state I am in and have also changed over time and it is just so frustrating. this has happened either though I have reset my network settings and in the settings app, my cellular data is on for all apps.

For some reason, I cannot search songs on spotify or receive and text photos. Every time I try to send photos on LTE, it shows up as not delivered and turns the text messages green. My friends have still been able to receive the image but it just shows up weridly on my phone. When my friends send a picture while I am on data, I cannot download the image and I think it shows up as heic and will not let me download it until I am on wifi. I can send normal texts but I cannot open snaps or Instagram DMs but for some reason i can use youtube and facetime. However, this has changed, a few months ago, I was able to use spotify and send and recieve images but I was not able to use youtube so I am not sure what changed with my data. Another thing is that depending on the state, different apps seem to work. In Florida and New York, Discord would never work and I can never send messages but when I was in Nevada/Utah, it worked for some reason. This thing also does not let me go on certain websites, I remember I was in walmart and I was trying to go on the walmart website and it wouldnt let me or load it.

I am honestly so confused and fed up with this and I am going to Italy for a study abroad trip where we will utilize Whatsapp, another app that does not work on data and I am concerned that I will not be able to get by. Has anyone experienced this problem?? What do I do? Please help I am so confused I know no one with this weird problem.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-27T01:08:30.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is probably going to be a long post but I have been experiencing weird problems with my data for the past two iPhones I had, (12 and 14).

"From the article: Apple has suffered a blow in its efforts to salvage its lucrative search placement deal with Google. A new ruling from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that Apple cannot participate in Google's upcoming antitrust hearing, which could leave a multibillion-dollar hole in Apple's balance sheet. The judges in the case say Apple simply waited too long to get involved.

Just a few years ago, a high-stakes court case involving Apple and Google would have found the companies on opposing sides, but not today. Apple's and Google's interests are strongly aligned here, to the tune of $20 billion. Google forks over that cash every year, and it's happy to do so to secure placement as the default search provider in the Safari desktop and mobile browser.

The antitrust penalties pending against Google would make that deal impermissible. Throughout the case, the government made the value of defaults clear—most people never change them. That effectively delivers Google a captive audience on Apple devices.

Google's ongoing legal battle with the DOJ's antitrust division is shaping up to be the most significant action the government has taken against a tech company since Microsoft in the late '90s. Perhaps this period of stability tricked Google's partners into thinking nothing would change, but the seriousness of the government's proposed remedies seems to have convinced them otherwise.

Google lost the case in August 2024, and the government proposed remedies in October. According to MediaPost, the appeals court took issue with Apple's sluggishness in choosing sides. It didn't even make its filing to participate in the remedy phase until November, some 33 days after the initial proposal. The judges ruled this delay ""seems difficult to justify.""",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-26T10:39:59.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the article: Apple has suffered a blow in its efforts to salvage its lucrative search placement deal with Google.

"I have had an iPhone 12 since December 2020. It has been an amazing phone for me until about 2 weeks ago, when it obviously hit its “best before” date. It burns battery, runs hot, is super slow, has run out of space (despite me paying for iCloud storage as well and deleting a bunch of images and a bunch of apps), my apps keep crashing, my CarPlay doesn’t work, etc.

I am looking at getting a new iPhone through my phone company. I was interested in the 15, but the 16 is on sale so I am looking at that. The only big difference I could see between the two is Apple Intelligence. I’m not an AI fan. I never use Siri, except for sending messages through CarPlay. I’m considering moving away from Google because of its stupid AI overview thing. 

Is Apple Intelligence going to be a pain? Can I easily disable most of the features? I have looked into what it does, and I am uninterested in most of it.

"I think the issue is combined latency. 10ms of total round-trip latency from pick attack to ear is fine IMO. It's the equivalent of standing 3.5m away from your Amp stack when it comes to speed of sound - and very few musicians would claim ""I can't play palm mutes unless I'm within 2m of my Amp"". But if you have 10ms on the audio interface and then another 10ms from your headphones and so on - sure, it adds up. I don't mind paying for good headphones, but I'll keep the audio analogue as soon as it exists my interface because it sure as hell would feel shitty for a pair of headphones of that price to not feel as usable for tracking guitars.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-25T13:01:42.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the issue is combined latency. 10ms of total round-trip latency from pick attack to ear is fine IMO.

"Noone but you can tell for sure. Apogee usually makes high quality products for Apple hardware with low latency in mind. But no matter how good the Jam X is at keeping it's own latency down, whatever latency the airpods max adds is going to be on top of that. One ""trick"" to keep in mind though, is that you can always increase your sample rate to lower your latency - with increased CPU usage as the drawback. So playing at 96khz will halve the latency of playing at 48khz. But will take more toll on your computer as a whole as it will essentially have to process twice as much per second. If you run tons and tons of cpu-intensive plugins on multiple simultaneous tracks the increased CPU usage might be an issue. If you're more into jamming and playing ""live"" with e.g. Backing tracks etc, going to 96khz probably won't have downsides. This is all still talking about the latency just on the computer and audio interface, considering it's still unknown what apple actually means in real numbers when they say ""ultra low latency"" for the aidpods max themselves. If it's 5ms or less, I doubt you'll ever notice it - if it's like 10-15ms, it may well be a noticeable issue.

Edit: oh, and also you'll have to wait for this firmware update to drop to see. The current firmware i think will never get you below 10-15ms of latency, and that could definitely be problematic. Now this also depends on your play style and needed precision. If you play technical stuff like Animals as Leaders type music with precision at speed, you'll be very latency sensitive. If you strum your guitar like Bruce Springsteen, 10ms here or there probably won't change much in how it feels.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-25T14:02:01.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noone but you can tell for sure.

"&gt;implying that the hardware isn't the bottleneck for impressive computing. Instead it's the algorithms.

Far from it. Firstly, this is inference, the ""runtime"" of already trained models. Secondly, as the article says:

&gt;The llama2.c project recommends the TinyStories model and for good reason. These small models have a hope of **producing some form of output** without any kind of specialized hardware acceleration.

&gt;I did most of my testing with the 15M variant of the model and then switched to the highest fidelity 110M model available. Anything beyond this would either be too large for the available 32-bit address space or too slow for the modest CPU and available memory bandwidth.

It is simply a technical exercise rather than actually aiming for something usable. Even a small model is in the Billions of parameters. 

&gt;In other words, why didn't we get LLMs a decade ago?

Other than technological constraints, generative AI is a new technique that evolved from previous innovations. There was no gen AI technique a decade ago, although the foundational techniques had started to emerge at that time.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-26T14:26:18.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Hey everyone,

I’m considering buying a brand-new MacBook Air M2 with 16GB of RAM for €823, and I’m wondering if it’s a good deal now that the M4 just came out.

My usage is pretty light: a bit of 3D printing with Fusion 360, some GarageBand, and I don’t need anything more than the Mac’s built-in display plus a single external monitor. The M4 seems nice, but there’s a €350 price difference, which isn’t insignificant.

I know the 256GB storage isn’t great, but I don’t mind carrying around an external SSD if needed.

Do you think the M2 is still worth it at this price, or does the M4 bring a real improvement for my use case?

Thanks for your thoughts! 😊",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-24T20:18:20.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

EDIT: All out of promo codes for now! But the app is still free to download from [the website](https://floaters.app) and use with no restrictions during the beta period. 

---

I've updated my app [Floaters](https://floaters.app) incorporating a lot of the feedback from my last post here.

For anyone who didn’t see the original post, Floaters is a scratchpad and notes app that’s meant to be used frequently while working in other apps. You can quickly show and hide Floaters via keyboard, and create linked notes while working on specific tasks. Linked notes move and act together as one, but can be edited individually. [Common use case](https://floaters.app/docs/use-cases/using-grouped-notes-to-complete-a-task) is scratchpad + draft internal response + draft customer response, for example. 

What I’ve added thanks to feedback from last post here:

- ✅ [**Full Markdown support**](https://floaters.app/docs/markdown/getting-started) - You can now style notes, create tasks, lists, headings, and more with inline Markdown. There’s a live parsing mode, or you can manually parse Markdown tags via keyboard shortcuts. Full export and copy-to-Markdown have also been added.
- ✅ [**Screenshots**](https://floaters.app/docs/screenshots/using-screenshots-in-floaters) - Take screenshots and attach floating scratchpads, notes, webpages, or whatever to them.
- ✅ **More formatting options** - In order to support Markdown, several more styling options are now available: code block, block quote, headings, dividers, strike through, highlight, inline code.
- ✅ **Less ugly** - People don’t like squared corners, even for sticky note apps. Floaters has embraced the roundness, while still being able to link sides of notes… flatly.
- ✅ [**Available on Mac App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/floaters-scratchpad-notes/id6743141530?mt=12) - If that's your preferred method of software acquirement. 

Please check it out and let me know what you think!

"While I agree with you, I also feel like people have become innovation junkies, We demand major breakups at a pace that's simply not possible. We take everything for granted and barely anything impresses us anymore.

5 years ago, Apple revolutionized not only laptops, but also desktop computers and tablets with the introduction of their M1 chip and its incredible performance and efficiency. This feat required designing a chip, which is complicated enough by itself, as well as reworking MacOS for it to work on a completely new architecture. On top of that, they also had to build a compatibility layer, because they knew it was unreasonable to expect every developer to be on board day one with the ARM architecture, so they made sure that apps developed for the x86 architecture would work in ARM.

And people's mind was understandably blown away. However, the high only lasted a year, with people completely disregarding the M2 as ""just a spec bump"". And I'm here thinking, do we really expect Apple (or anyone really) to come up with a brand new architecture that boosts Mac's performance to never before seen levels, and doubles the battery life to 40 hours of use, every year? and yes, I know, they don't have to release a new slightly better chip every year, but you don't have to buy every machine they release either. You can keep your M1 until you judge that the performance jump added by all the ""little"" spec bumps is enough of an upgrade for you to get.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-24T10:53:13.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I agree with you, I also feel like people have become innovation junkies, We demand major breakups at a pace that&amp;#39;s simply not possible.

This doesn't make sense either. The killing of royal core was keeping with the status quo. And Pat was the one who was keeping *his* pet project- discrete consumer graphics- alive, much to the detriment of other more important projects.

This never came up, nor was it ever confirmed. If anything, the opposite just got revealed, when the CEO of synopsys revealed that 18A is performing in between TSMC's best (either referring to N2 or N3P) and their predecessor (prob some early variant of N3, or worst case N4P). 

&gt;Then it surfaced that Intel (like always) didn't focus on super high-density libraries not because they couldn't,

It almost certainly is because they couldn't. Intel 3's HD libs are barely a density improvement over Intel 4's, and Intel 7's HD libs were stopped being used in RPL-S (or ADL-S IIRC) because they were hurting yields, despite going HD meaning they reduce the overall die area. 

And og Intel 10nm HD libs were so cursed that they had to literally fuse off the iGPU for CNL anyway. 

&gt; but because they just aren't really useful for high-performance chips

The iGPUs of those high-performance chips are often in HD libs. Prior to the M4 (or M3, I forget) Apple used HD libs for their CPU cores (which were also the highest performing or tied for highest performing), and moved to fin-flex 3-2 libs later. AMD continues to use HD libs for their cores, while hitting the same Fmax as Intel. 

The booming market of AI GPUs almost certainly use HD libs as the standard cell as well...

"Consumer graphics is absolutely CRITICAL to Intel's survival. Nvidia recently entered the CPU market and it's only a matter of time before they have consumer offerings instead of just commercial/dev platforms. AMD also fired shots with Strix Halo.

Discrete GPUs are critical to getting buy-in to develop for your GPU on the Windows platform. Intel has shipped GPUs for 20+ years to no avail. Something has to change to keep them competitive as the x86 monopoly fades.

Lack of a super-compact library could put TSMC ahead on paper, but not in practice. In any case, being ahead on high-performance efficiency is far more important on cutting edge nodes.

&gt; It almost certainly is because they couldn't. Intel 3's HD libs are barely a density improvement over Intel 4's, and Intel 7's HD libs were stopped being used in RPL-S (or ADL-S IIRC) because they were hurting yields, despite going HD meaning they reduce the overall die area.

Intel 3 and Intel 4 are on the same node. Density of N5 and N4P are also essentially identical. This isn't an indicator of anything. Likewise, FinFET density doesn't reveal very much about GAAFET because they are very different processes.

&gt; And og Intel 10nm HD libs were so cursed that they had to literally fuse off the iGPU for CNL anyway.

What does this have to do with anything at all? Intel tried to do too much at one time while also not using EUV. They went from 3 years ahead to 3 years behind until they could rework their 10nm process a few times.  It is pretty much the only screw-up in Intel Fab history. Research into more advanced nodes and processes like GAAFET continued to progress in other research groups even while 10nm failed. They've since managed (even by your Synopsis claim) to close the gap down to less than a year.

All of this is arguing around what matters. TODAY, Apple uses 3x2 layout because they are trying to hit those high clockspeeds (a mistake IMO). If they were to build on Intel 18a, they'd STILL be using a high-performance layout. What they did a few years ago simply doesn't matter.

&gt; AMD continues to use HD libs for their cores, while hitting the same Fmax as Intel.

You are misinterpreting. 2x2 is 30% smaller than 2x3. AMD claims that Zen5c is 25% smaller than Zen5. This means Zen5c is using MEDIUM 2x2 layouts for most of the transistors and LARGE 2x3 layouts for the rest. It's more dense than their normal libraries, but less dense than actually dense 1x2 layouts which would theoretically give a 66% reduction in core size, but drop peak frequencies to under 2.5GHz (maybe under 2GHz).",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-24T18:02:33.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer graphics is absolutely CRITICAL to Intel&amp;#39;s survival.

"I’m not an expert, but the way I understand it, it’s about how efficiently (when you factor in energy efficiency, volume, weight, and complexity) you can produce torque. 

Electric motors are more efficient at turning energy into torque than gas engines and gas engines are more efficient when they aren’t trying to produce a lot of torque (much simpler gear system, don’t have to rev up and down constantly, fewer cylinders, etc). So you have a plug in electric vehicle with a larger battery than you can normally fit into a plug in hybrid, and a small gas engine with no transmission (most hybrids have a belt system called CVT) that produces just enough energy to power the motors and keep the battery topped up at a certain point. They also have regenerative braking like all hybrid and electric cars.

In the end, you get a smaller battery than a high range electric car, but a bigger battery than a plug-in hybrid (but a smaller engine). Which means it’s lighter than either but still has a decent battery plus the engine. So, you get longer range than a plug in hybrid but still can use gas. I’m sure there are other tradeoffs.

You’re basically removing a lot of the complexity of a hybrid and still getting all of the benefits. An electric car (especially a lighter short range vehicle) would still be more energy efficient, but this isn’t a bad trade off if you want range.

"13 vs 16e in 2025

I am looking for a new phone since my 64GB iphone SE isn’t really meeting my storage needs anymore. I am looking for good value for money.

At the moment I am in two minds about choosing either the iphone 13 or the iphone 16e, it is a €170 price difference for me (I am a student). My main pro about the 13 is the wide angle camera. For the 16e its the better battery life. The price difference for the 14 vs 16e is only €50, so I think I would choose the latter (MagSafe is of no importance to me).

"Remember a few things:

First, John Giannandrea is a brilliant computer scientist. Under his leadership, Google made the Knowledge Graph, Google Now, Google Assistant, and yes, the transformer model — you know, the thing that is responsible for the “AI” everyone is wetting their pants about

Second, Apple has DRI’s, or directly responsible individuals. If something goes right, wrong, or otherwise on a  Product or feature, that person is responsible ultimately. That way if you need to go to someone for help with an issue, you aren’t bounced around a trillion people who refuse to take responsibility 

Mike Rockwell being in charge of Siri as a product seems to be what is happening, reporting to Craig, apparently. It seems he is Siri’s DRI. Keeping John Giannandrea is important. Anyone who says otherwise is a fool.

If there was anyone to actually fire, it’s Tor Myhren. I’m not saying he should be fired, but he’s in large part responsible for how Apple’s marketing works, in addition to Greg Joswiak

Edit:

As a completely irrelevant side note, could John Gruber be anymore insufferable than he has already been in the last however long this saga has gone on for? Dude has gone from hating Gurman to riding him in 0.3 seconds flat. No, just because you hate Siri doesn’t mean you need to hype up the tabloidist. 

And no, just because Gurman says it hasn’t been announced internally doesn’t mean it wasn’t announced internally before Gurman found out, Gruber. Do you seriously think Apple is going to say, “oh, actually that moved was announced at this secret meeting and implemented over the weekend?” No. They will say nothing, whether Gurman is right, wrong, or anything. 

Again, you (rightfully) spend a bunch of time clearly articulating why we shouldn’t trust Gurman or Bloomberg, and then now you’re suddenly on the Gurman bandwagon. Again, just because you hate Siri doesn’t mean you need to hype up his hysteria, Gruber.


Edit 2:

If you want to learn about DRI’s, you can read some stuff on it here from a former Apple team member. I highly recommend instituting this if you’re creating a team

(Turn on Reader Mode.)

Edit 3: I’m confused. Gurman made a big article about a meeting under Siri’s team leader Robby  Walker, so what happened to him? Does he still work at Apple? Not my business, but the fact that Gurman doesn’t even mention it articulates exactly why his “reporting” is BS

Edit 4: “AI” are LLMs, which are transformers models, which is machine learning.

"deciding between 

m4 15” MBA

m4 14” MBP

it understand all the differences but having trouble weighing them in my head.
for stuff i care about, the air has screen size well above my 13” air im trading in. the pro has charging port on the right side too which matters to me but i can continue to live without if i must. pro is $200 more but comes with double the storage as well as all those other upgrades i can live without such as promotion display


i dont plan on using it for anything special i just wanted a big display. the pro seems like the better deal at $1400 vs $1200 but im worried the screen size is not enough difference from what i already have, despite the pro having a higher resolution 


outside of trying the screens in the store im having the hardest time deciding between these two

"Confused about which MacBook variant to go for: MacBook Pro 14"" M4 vs. MacBook Air 15"" M4 for Brand Identity Designer – Which One? 


I'm helping a friend choose between the MacBook Pro 14.2"" M4 and MacBook Air 15.3"" M4

Use Case:
She's a brand identity designer, mainly using:

1. Adobe Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Lightroom)
2. Figma for UI/UX
3. Procreate 
4. Notion for organization
Note: No video editing or 3D work (usually)

She's currently using an HP Victus 15.6"" (Windows) and is switching to Apple. However, she’s unsure whether moving down to 14.2"" (Pro) will be a hassle.

Now, I did some of my own research and here are some considerations and Pros/Cons:

MacBook Air 15.3"" (M4):

✅ Pros:
1. Bigger screen (closer to what she's used to)
2. Still powerful enough for her workload

❌Cons:
1. No ProMotion 120Hz, slightly lower display quality - (great for smooth animations, but most design tools, including Adobe apps and Figma, don't rely on it. So, not really a dealbreaker, imo)
2. Slower charging, slightly lower battery life - (but still lasts a full workday)
3. Inferior speakers vs. Pro - (but still very solid)

MacBook Pro 14.2"" (M4):

✅ Pros:
1. Brighter Liquid Retina XDR display (HDR support)
2. ProMotion (120Hz refresh rate)
3. Better speakers &amp; better cooling for sustained performance

❌Cons:
1. Smaller screen (might feel cramped)


Main Dilemma:

1. Is the 14.2"" screen too small for a designer switching from 15.6""?
2. Will the Air 15"" M4 be enough, or will she regret not going for the Pro?

P.S.: The budget is not a problem. Budget wise she can easily go for the MacBook Pro 14.2"" variant (however, not the 16"" variant, that would be too expensive).

Kindly let me know if it would be wrong of me to suggest the MacBook Air 15.3"" M4 variant, or if I'm missing something out somewhere.

"That all comes down to one’s personal preference. Does she want a larger screen or HDR? If she can’t have both in the 16"" MBP, then she must decide what to take and what to sacrifice.

There are two other issues with the Air. One, the Air doesn’t have any cooling system, so it’ll throttle performance if it gets too hot. Two, the Air doesn’t have an HDMI output port, so if HDMI out is important, then she’ll either need a Pro or a USB-to-HDMI adapter.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-21T13:41:20.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;That all comes down to one’s personal preference.

Not that I'm aware of, and it's not a good idea either.

1. In most jurisdictions I can think of, passcodes are protected under anti-self-incrimination laws (such as the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution) but biometrics are not.
2. That's an easy way to get locked out of your laptop if you lose both your hands in a freak accident or such.

&gt; such that, if someone has my computer login, they still can't use my passwords without my fingerprint?

In this case, I'd recommend that you 1—use a third-party vault (like 1Password or Bitwarden) and not the first-party one built into your OS or browser, and 2—give it a passcode different from the one you use to log into your device.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-21T22:33:31.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Regular microfiber cloths have a fiber size of 6 µm (6 microns) which is more than sufficient for normal glass and normal surfaces; but the nano texture laser cuts etchings into the glass that are smaller than 6 µm so Apple commissioned a cloth that is 1 µm or a bit less, so that the individual fiber can better push out dust and gunk or whatever is stuck inside the etchings.

So Apple Polishing Cloth is unnecessary for normal glass but certainly necessary for nano texture. 

Still, Apple is probably way overcharging for it which sucks if you want to buy 2 or 3 of them. $6 is a good deal.

EDIT: corrected thanks to /u/cogit4se

EDIT 2: [here is photo evidence of the fiber-size differences](https://i.imgur.com/hy6YujR.png)

EDIT 3: For reference, the human hair is average 100 µm, with normal vision we can only distinguish down to 40 µm, and a blood cell is 8 µm, so microfibers are almost unimaginably small.

The European Commission announced interoperability requirements for Apple under the Digital Markets Act, mandating changes to iOS 19 and 20. 

These changes include enabling third-party smartwatches to display iOS notifications, making automatic audio switching available to third-party headphones, and allowing third-party AirDrop and AirPlay alternatives.

&lt;p&gt;Apple criticised these requirements as hindering innovation and favouring competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

"Summary from 9to5Mac: 

The list of features that the EU commission has ordered Apple to implement is vast, as well as signalling that any future Apple features with first-party hardware integrations must also be made available to third-party companies.

Today’s measures revolve around opening up iOS connectivity features. This includes allowing connected devices, like third-party smartwatches, full access to the iOS notification system, as well as background execution privileges, just like how the Apple Watch works with the iPhone.

Headphone makers will be given access to system features that support AirPods, like proximity auto-pairing and automatic audio switching. Other kinds of connected devices must also be able to make equivalent features to system services like AirDrop and AirPlay.

Other requirements include automatically providing access to Wi-Fi network information to accessories, enable high-bandwidth peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and open up the NFC chip to communicate data like user payment card details to third-party connected devices.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-19T15:19:23.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary from 9to5Mac: &lt;/p&gt;

"From the article: The European Commission today [announced](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816) the decisions of its interoperability proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its obligations under the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), but Apple has come out swinging, calling them “bad for our products and bad for our European users.”

The DMA, which came into force last year, requires major platform holders or “gatekeepers” like Apple to provide third-party developers equal access to iOS and iPadOS system tools and features.

The Commission’s first proceeding focused on iOS connectivity features for third-party connected devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets. The decisions specify how Apple will provide effective interoperability for functionalities such as notifications, device pairing, and connectivity and data transfer functions like AirDrop and AirPlay.

*The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (e.g. pairing).*

The second proceeding focused on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requests submitted by developers and third parties for iOS and iPadOS.

*Developers will benefit from a fast and fair handling of their interoperability requests. The measures will accelerate their ability to offer a wider choice to European consumers of innovative services and hardware that interoperate with iPhones and iPads.*

The final measures set out in the two specification decisions follow an extensive engagement with Apple and input by third parties as part of the public consultation launched in December 2024.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-19T16:28:52.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the article: The European Commission today &lt;a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the decisions of its interoperability proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its obligations under the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), but Apple has come out swinging, calling them “bad for our products and bad for our European users.”&lt;/p&gt;

"Its not like a blockbuster feature, but i use my s22 ultra zoom all the time to see animals from my balcony when I dont know what I'm seeing at a distance. I LOVE it for that.

I have loved my Samsung phones, but they're kinda like apple now. Small changes year over year. If you're already a Samsung person, it's not exciting usually when the new phone comes out.

Apple will complain and say it's unfair. But will comply. They won't leave a market like the EU unless it actually costs them more money than they would make.

"Hey everyone, I’m looking to buy a **used MacBook Air M1** mainly for **coding and entertainment** (watching videos, light content creation, etc.). I’ve found three options that are in my budget and need help deciding which one offers the best **value for money**.

# Option 1 - ($430)

* **8GB RAM / 256GB SSD**
* **11 charge cycles, 99% battery health**
* Purchased in **2023**
* Comes with **only the charger** (no box, no invoice)

# Option 2 - ($500)

* **8GB RAM / 256GB SSD**
* **80 charge cycles, 97% battery health**
* Purchased in **March 2024**
* **Box + original charger included** (no invoice)

# Option 3 - ($520) 

* **16GB RAM / 256GB SSD**
* **170 charge cycles, 90% battery health**
* Minor dent on the corner
* No known issues

# My Priorities:

1. **Best value for money** (not overpaying for minor differences).
2. **Battery life** – I want something that will last long without needing a battery replacement soon.
3. **Performance** – I mainly need it for **coding**, so **16GB RAM sounds tempting**, but I don’t know if it’s worth it.

Which one do you think is the best choice? Would the **lower battery health of the 16GB model be a concern** in the long run? Also, if I go with the **cheaper one, what checks should I do to ensure it’s not locked and has original parts?**",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-20T04:26:39.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I’m looking to buy a &lt;strong&gt;used MacBook Air M1&lt;/strong&gt; mainly for &lt;strong&gt;coding and entertainment&lt;/strong&gt; (watching videos, light content creation, etc.). I’ve found three options that are in my budget and need help deciding which one offers the best &lt;strong&gt;value for money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Option 1 - ($430)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8GB RAM / 256GB SSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 charge cycles, 99% battery health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchased in &lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comes with &lt;strong&gt;only the charger&lt;/strong&gt; (no box, no invoice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Option 2 - ($500)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8GB RAM / 256GB SSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80 charge cycles, 97% battery health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchased in &lt;strong&gt;March 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box + original charger included&lt;/strong&gt; (no invoice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Option 3 - ($520)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16GB RAM / 256GB SSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;170 charge cycles, 90% battery health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor dent on the corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No known issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Priorities:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best value for money&lt;/strong&gt; (not overpaying for minor differences).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery life&lt;/strong&gt; – I want something that will last long without needing a battery replacement soon.&lt;/li&gt;

"Yeah I get it eat the rich blah blah, but tbh when you compare the amount of value generated by those employees vs what they’re paid? It’s still a small amount. And honestly Apple employees aren’t all filthy rich. They’re well off for sure but they’re closer to being an average person than they are to being truly rich. One injury or layoff still puts them in a very scary predicament, maybe they have a few years more runway than most people but it’s not like being “filthy rich” imo. That would be more like someone who isn’t affected by being laid off or bad market movements. Someone who doesn’t have to budget to reach their financial goals or worry if their retirement dropped 10% a month for multiple months. 

Also Apple has ~30% operating margin. If half their R&amp;D represents the SWE salaries, you could increase all of their pay by 20% and have a negligible impact on the operating margin right?

"Yes people need to stop comparing wages against other workers and compare to the value being generated. Comparing to other workers only stand to benefit the corporations in suppressing your wages. It's how you get things like cost-of-living adjusted wages despite a remote worker in India working the same job, generating the same value, but getting paid like 10x less while the company still makes the same revenue off that labor, and then people defend that. As far as im concerned, if 2 people provide the same value, doing the same job, they should at least be paid the same. Arguing otherwise is just to benefit corporations in maximizing their exploitation.

And when it comes to Apple specifically, they make so much money that if they had a 50% profit share with employees like NBA players get (NBA players actually get 50% revenue, so even better still), Apple can afford to give every single one of it's 164k employees a $283k bonus while still retaining nearly $50 billion in profit. Workers across the board are underpaid for the value they generate.

im on the 9 pro fold at the moment and im going back to iphone and just getting an android tablet on the side next time. its really not worth the extra cost considering the cuts they make to camera/ display/ performance/ battery to make it work over just having 2 separate devices.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-18T19:09:38.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;mediocre. like i said, it seems great to have a phone that opens into a mini tablet, but when you compare it, the open screen YouTube/ Netflix/ movie experience is the same size as watching it on a normal phone (like only slightly bigger).&lt;/p&gt;

Uh… I complete forgot he was the dude who made Beeper. Literally this reeks of scamming. No way on Earth this product costs $75 to make (50% profit margin). Notably, apparently if the price changes due to the current economic situation, apparently YOU need to cover the difference.

This plus the fact that it’s a 30 day warranty reeks of crap. Screw this

Edit 2: It literally has 16 MB of storage. MEGABYTES. 

Dude is straight up using customers to fund his custom watch for himself, and make some money to boot off of it; doesn’t give a damn about customers, the product, or the experience.

"Since when has Apple cared about consumer backlash?

The article mentions the headphone jack and how there was backlash there from customers and how many Android providers poked fun at it, but then followed that up with acknowledging that a lack of a headphone jack is almost an industry standard now for smartphones.

"The thing about rental server time is that it keeps producing profit, and if it goes well, the customer becomes permanently dependent at which point you can raise the rent for even more profit. It's a great business model.

Sell a computer once, and if it's powerful enough, you may not be able to extract additional revenue from that customer for years, and there's even a risk that they will buy their next one from someone else.

This is why we need complex AI models to do things that even just a decade ago everyone did on their local hardware without a second thought. Grammar check? You don't need a simple library of rules that can run on a 486, you need a massive 4 terabyte LLM that you could never hope to run on accessible hardware, because that's where the profit is long term. Never mind what the consumer actually wants or needs, we can convince them that they need 100x the computing power to accomplish essentially the same task 5% better or faster and with more interesting mistakes.",,,"apple","r/apple","2025-03-18T12:46:04.000Z","comment",,,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing about rental server time is that it keeps producing profit, and if it goes well, the customer becomes permanently dependent at which point you can raise the rent for even more profit.
