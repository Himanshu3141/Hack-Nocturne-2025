A lot of the questions I was able to answer, and I responded with answers via email after the interview.\n\nHowever, I felt that some of the questions were a bit too complex for L1.  I answered as best I could, though.  I was also advised that I need more SIEM and EDR experience.  I mean, how do I get that eyes on glass experience without being in a role?\n\nIt's incredibly disheartening.  Has anyone been in a similar situation?  How did you land that SOC job?  I feel so dejected, depressed, and annoyed at the moment.  I have a job (sec engineering), which they said was infrastructure. Its more than infrastructure.",

But now I'm also doubting that narrative.\n\nEditing to add more clarity:  Even if proxied/stolen IP addresses were in use, this doesn't affect the resource issue as they clearly have the resources to impact many sites.  (We have ample resources to serve traffic to a large individual DOS attack attempt.)  And having the technical know how to steal IPs should go along with the expertise to not keep hitting the same URL.  Iterating on a single URL doesn't just hurt us, it wastes massive amounts of time for a web crawler (allegedly) trying to gain broad information.  And this has been going on for weeks based on what I'm hearing from some others.  How have the devs not noticed the crawler getting bogged down on single sites?  How have they not noticed the geo blocks?  As many people have put in geo blocks for all of Brazil, this must be impacting the entire nation's Internet access.  Has no one in Brazil noticed all these blocks?

Their behavior has been met with repeated criticism, including making false statements (ref: [@thegrugq](https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/902600568262107136)) and renewed claims of plagiarism (refs: [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18783493) c. 2018, [reddit.com](https://reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/mczutz/the_hacker_news_profiting_off_extensive/) c. 2021). Due to these incidents, THN links have been banned from several subreddits including r/privacy, r/technology, and r/hacking.\n\nWe would hope that THN is now appropriately crediting sources of its content or writing its own original content, however we are unable to police each and every article.

The hours were long, the pay low - or, well, at least that&amp;#39;s how it works for most anime, perhaps I am libeling Miyazaki and his studio is the nicest one - but he doesn&amp;#39;t seem like an easy boss. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hey, they do get paid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we have a tool that lets people like Miyazaki send all the pencil pushers home and replace them with a few keyboard clackers. The people who stand to lose from this aren&amp;#39;t the Miyazakis of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is further accentuated in this other example, where I prompted specifically for a high frequency detail texture (\"create the image of a grainy texture, abstract shape, very extremely highly detailed\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9oxiv2l3bere1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f0d54b8e30a098059d2582b07f1619b342e3a7a\n\nInterestingly, I got only three images here from the BE; and the details being added is obvious:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd272i64bere1.png?width=2058&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dde7365700835b45fc6371587fc51b9088b20d0\n\nThis could be done of course as a separate post processing step too, for example like SDXL introduced the refiner model back in the days that was specifically trained to add details to the VAE latent representation before decoding it to pixel space.\n\nIt's also unclear if I got less images with this prompt due to availability (i.e. the BE could give me more flops), or to some kind of specific optimization (eg: latent caching).\n\n**So where I am at now:**\n\n* It's probably a multi step process pipeline\n* OpenAI in the model card is stating that \"Unlike DALL¬∑E, which operates as a diffusion model, 4o image generation is an autoregressive model natively embedded within ChatGPT\"\n* This makes me think of this recent paper: [OmniGen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11340)\n\nThere they directly connect the VAE of a Latent Diffusion architecture to an LLM and learn to model jointly both text and images; they observe few shot capabilities and emerging properties too which would explain the vast capabilities of GPT4-o, and it makes even more sense  if we consider the usual OAI formula:\n\n* More / higher quality data\n* More flops\n\nThe architecture proposed in OmniGen has *great* potential to scale given that is purely transformer based - and if we know one thing is surely that transformers scale well, and that OAI is especially good at that\n\n**What do you think?** would love to take this as a space to investigate together!

My task is to verify and possibly expand on this information using the available tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I need to understand what SCP-3626 is and its relation to the Wanderer&amp;#39;s Library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can start by performing a web search for &amp;quot;SCP-3626&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Wanderer&amp;#39;s Library.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ll use the search action with the query &amp;quot;SCP-3626 AND Wanderer&amp;#39;s Library.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait, but I need to make sure that I&amp;#39;m using the correct format for the function call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The format is:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Instead of sitting down and doing detailed planning for 3, 4, 6, 12, or more months, you're planning (for most agile methods) a maximum of 6 weeks out. However, the value of those plans is much greater since you have much more clarity in what you need to and can do in those few weeks.\n\nBut you're talking about design and how much you should do before starting work. This is a question of risk. Spending 4-5 hours to do a more detailed design could make sense if it mitigates risk. Looking at it the other way, if you spent an hour designing 10 tables a week, you'd not only spend more time designing (100 hours across 10 weeks), but if you realized a problem, you'd not only have to change your designs but also your implementations and test cases. And if you have data in those tables, you'd have to write data migrations, too. The cost of getting something wrong is high.\n\nOf course, there are still questions. Instead of spending 4-5 hours, would it have been better to spend 2 at a higher level of abstraction? Or 8 hours and get into more details? Maybe. But the point is that up-front design reduces risk, which materializes in defects, rework, and schedule and/or budget overruns.

Fight that urge for at least the first six months. If you must, take a note about it and come back to it later. Even if you're 100% correct (which you probably won't be), it's not worth the social capital of appearing like the know-it-all new hire.\n* Remain curious. Continue to think and learn about the system.\n* Take notes. Make it your goal to ask lots of questions, but never the same question twice.\n* When asking questions, make sure to ask in a productive way. The two biggest mistakes I've seen are, firstly, not demonstrating enough effort. Don't ask how to get your build to work. Instead, say \"hey, my build isn't working and I've tried &lt;x, y, z&gt; to fix it, but am stuck on &lt;foo&gt;.\" The second big mistake for juniors is not asking about the actual problem, also knows as the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). Avoid this!\n* In general, fix things as you encounter them. You will (hopefully) get some onboarding docs, and some entry projects. You'll probably encounter parts of the docs that are unclear, or outdated. If you have to ask someone for help, don't just take the help and move on. Instead, update the docs so that the next person doesn't hit the same problem.\n* Above anything else, socialize. All the above are minor issues that can (and will be) overlooked if someone is just fun to be around and a good coworker. That is the most important thing. Go grab coffee with the coworkers. Attend the team lunch. Go to the optional after-work happy hour.

In 2 weeks you make the outer structure first without panting without any nitty gritty details and show it to the customer. Then only if the customer approves, you move forward to painting for next 2 weeks and ask for feedback. If the customer doesn't like it you take a week and make the required changes. Once the structure and design is approved by the customer you move on to engine and repeat the feedback loop for alp the parts of the car.\n\nThis ensures that each part of the Car is made in accordance to the customer's liking. When the whole car is ready the customer is most likely to be happy and would ask for minimal changes since on every step you asked the customer for feedback, improved upon it and moved on. \n\nThis reason why it is iterative is because you repeat the process of: building -&gt; showcasing -&gt; getting feedback - approved or needs improvement -&gt; improving or moving on to next -&gt; showcasing -&gt; getting feedback and so on...\n\nIt is called incremental because you don't build the whole thing at once but step by step. You build something and then add on top of it.\n\nThe car is the software or a feature here and the two weeks time is called a Sprint.

  "body": "I'm glad you came to those realizations.  Mapping your experiences to mine, yeah, it really seems you're on a good track.  It's always cool when others figure this stuff out through actually doing it.\n\nRegarding \"TDD for bugs\" - nah, TDD is absolutely key for feature development too.  It's not just for cleaning up messes afterwards; it's about building things right from the start, properly designed.\n\nWhat's been a game changer for me is data-driven TDD, especially when you combine it with really clean boundaries between your core domain and all the external junk.  Seriously, this combo makes testing way easier and keeps things maintainable, *especially* when you're figuring out your **testing boundaries**.\n\nThink about it ‚Äì data-driven tests, they move you away from tests that break every time you breathe on the code.  Instead, you nail down the *contract* of your units with data.  And \"units\" isn't just functions or classes, right? It's **use cases** and even **facades for complex bits** like heavy algorithms ‚Äì *those* are your units, your testing boundaries.  Fixtures become more than just setup; they're like living examples of how your system behaves for these units. They're basically mini-specs for your use cases and algorithm facades - that's how you define your testing boundaries.\n\nAnd Ports and Adapters, that architecture you mentioned?  Gold for this.  It naturally isolates your app core ‚Äì use cases, algorithms, all that good stuff ‚Äì from the chaotic outside world.  This isolation lets you test your core logic properly, in total isolation, using test doubles for the \"ports\" to fake the outside.  Makes tests way simpler and way more resistant to infrastructure changes. Data-driven TDD and Ports &amp; Adapters?  Perfect match.  You can nail down and check use case behavior, even complex algo facade behavior, with solid data, within those clear testing boundaries.\n\nSo, yeah, all my unit tests follow the same pattern, aimed at testing these units - use cases and facades:\n\n*   **Configure test doubles with fixture data.** Fixtures pre-program your dependencies for the specific unit you're testing. You literally spell out, in data, how external systems should act during this test. Makes test assumptions obvious, no hidden setup in your testing boundary.\n*   **Exercise the SUT with a DTO from fixtures.** DTOs from fixtures = consistent, defined inputs for your use case or facade.  Repeatable tests, test context is clear - you're testing a specific scenario within your unit's boundary.\n*   **Expected values from fixtures too.**  Inputs data-driven, outputs data-driven. Fixtures for expected values too.  Makes test intent super clear, less chance of wrong expectations in your testing boundary.  Tweak fixture data, tweak scenarios, different outcomes for your unit.\n*   **Assert expected == actual.**  End of the line, data vs data.  Assertions are readable, laser-focused on the behavior of the use case or algo facade *inside* its boundary.\n\nThis structured thing, fixtures, Ports &amp; Adapters focusing on use cases and facades as your testing boundaries ‚Äì big wins:\n\n*   **Predictable &amp; Readable Tests:**  Same structure = less brainpower needed. Anyone can get what a test is doing, testing a use case or facade. Fixtures, if named well, are living docs for your unit's behavior within its testing boundary.\n*   **Maintainable Tests:** Data-driven, decoupled via test doubles and Ports &amp; Adapters domain separation = refactoring becomes way less scary for use cases and algos behind facades. Code changes in your core? Tests less likely to break, as long as data contracts for your units at their boundaries are good.\n*   **Focus on Behavior:** Data &amp; fixtures = testing behavior of use cases and facades, not implementation details.  Textbook unit testing &amp; TDD, especially with Ports &amp; Adapters, test different levels clearly as separate units.\n*   **Deeper Understanding:**  Good fixtures, data-driven tests for use cases and algorithm facades... forces you to *really* understand the requirements, the domain, inside those boundaries. You're basically writing down your understanding of how the system *should* act in a precise, runnable form for each unit.\n\nYeah, setting this up - fixtures, data-driven TDD, Ports &amp; Adapters with use cases &amp; facades as units - takes upfront work, no lie. But for long-term test quality, maintainability, everyone on the same page?  Totally worth it, especially in complex finance and e-commerce. Clarity, robustness, testability across the whole system ‚Äì crucial.",

  "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do most what you present by self improvement. Broaders test tend to have much more value than narrower tests. Narrow test are specific to a function and class and are sometime useful but I much prefer broader tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also test that are comparing data (like 2 json/xml) tend to be much more stable and easier to scale. You just add more input/output pairs. It goes to the point. 1 test code can be used for 5-10-50 cases if necessary and you can just run them in a few seconds and check the diff to understand instantly what it is all about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case I need to understand the functional issue/feature first and most likely we might have to design the grammar and give an example or 2 of what is really expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my experience that example give the direction but tend to be wrong as the beginning. The client/functional expert is typically lying or getting things half wrong, not on purpose but because we don&amp;#39;t have the real data yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I will build my code using that. Often the code output something different and more accurate than the man-made example. In all case I validate by checking/validating the actual output that become the expected output.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t fancy much to write the test first and then code part of TDD. Some time its great, sometime not and it is bigotry. I prefer to be pragmatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

  "body": "Below is a concise comparison of mocks with each of the other main categories of test doubles. In practice, these distinctions can blur depending on the testing framework, but understanding the canonical definitions helps to maintain clarity in your tests.\n\n\n---\n\n1. Mocks vs. Dummies\n\nDefinition\n\nDummy: A placeholder object passed around but never actually used. Typically provides no real data or behavior‚Äîjust meets parameter requirements so code can compile or run.\n\nMock: A test double that both simulates behavior and captures expectations about how it should be called (method calls, parameters, etc.). Often used to verify that specific interactions occur.\n\n\nKey Difference\n\nDummies only exist to satisfy method signatures; they‚Äôre not called in meaningful ways.\n\nMocks have behavior expectations and verification logic built in; you‚Äôre checking how your system-under-test interacts with them.\n\n\nPractical Example\n\nA ‚Äúdummy‚Äù user object used just to fill a constructor parameter that‚Äôs never referenced in the test body.\n\nA ‚Äúmock‚Äù user repository that verifies whether saveUser() gets called exactly once with specific arguments.\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Mocks vs. Stubs\n\nDefinition\n\nStub: Provides predefined responses to method calls but doesn‚Äôt record usage. Primarily used to control the input state of the system under test.\n\nMock: Also can provide responses, but critically, it verifies method calls and arguments as part of the test.\n\n\nKey Difference\n\nStubs are passive: they return canned data without caring how or when they‚Äôre invoked.\n\nMocks are active: the test validates that certain calls happened (or didn‚Äôt happen) in a prescribed way.\n\n\nPractical Example\n\nA ‚Äústub‚Äù payment service that always returns ‚Äúpayment succeeded‚Äù so you can test order workflow without a real payment processor.\n\nA ‚Äúmock‚Äù payment service that asserts the charge() method is called with the correct amount exactly once.\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. Mocks vs. Fakes\n\nDefinition\n\nFake: A working implementation that‚Äôs simpler or cheaper than the real thing but still provides functional behavior (often in-memory). It‚Äôs more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than a stub but not suitable for production.\n\nMock: Typically doesn‚Äôt provide a full real implementation; it mainly focuses on verifying interactions.\n\n\nKey Difference\n\nFakes run real logic (e.g., an in-memory database) and may store state in a lightweight, simplified manner.\n\nMocks do not provide a full simulation of state or real-world functionality; they‚Äôre more about checking method interactions.\n\n\nPractical Example\n\nA ‚Äúfake‚Äù database that stores data in a map/dictionary so tests can run quickly without an actual DB.\n\nA ‚Äúmock‚Äù database that doesn‚Äôt really store anything but checks if insertRecord() was called with the right parameters.\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Mocks vs. Spies\n\nDefinition\n\nSpy: Records how a dependency is used (method calls, arguments) for later verification, and may return some values but typically not complex logic. Spies are often real objects wrapped with instrumentation.\n\nMock: Often set up with expected calls and behaviors upfront; you fail the test if the usage doesn‚Äôt match the expectation.\n\n\nKey Difference\n\nSpies focus on recording actual usage (you verify after the fact).\n\nMocks set upfront the expected usage (you verify during or at the end of the test that these expectations were met).\n\n\nPractical Example\n\nA ‚Äúspy‚Äù email sender that records each email request so you can later assert: assertThat(spyEmailSender.getSentEmails().size()).isEqualTo(1).\n\nA ‚Äúmock‚Äù email sender that fails the test immediately if the sendEmail() method isn‚Äôt called exactly once with the exact subject and recipient.\n\n\n\n---\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n1. Purpose:\n\nDummies exist solely to fill parameter slots.\n\nStubs supply canned responses without logic or checks.\n\nFakes provide a lightweight but working version of a real dependency.\n\nSpies record interactions for later assertions.\n\nMocks anticipate and assert specific calls up front.\n\n\n\n2. Verification Strategy:\n\nDummies, Stubs, Fakes are not generally used to verify how the system under test interacts with them.\n\nMocks, Spies are used to verify interactions and usage patterns.\n\n\n\n3. Complexity:\n\nDummies are trivial; they do next to nothing.\n\nStubs are only as complicated as the return values needed for the test.\n\nFakes can be moderately complex (in-memory stores, partial logic).\n\nMocks, Spies require a bit more upfront configuration/verification logic, but they often give more robust feedback on the system‚Äôs behavior.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding and using the right type of test double is crucial for clean tests that isolate functionality effectively and communicate intent clearly.",

Instead, it will have to continue retrying the message at the tip of the queue.\n    * A commit (whether automatic or manual) stores an *offset* within a partition, not a per-message confirmation.\n* However, if you have multiple consumers that are working on other partitions, those can still make progress.\n\nThese limitations (especially offset-based instead of per-message commits) might make more sense if you understand that Kafka is geared towards high-throughput use cases, but not towards maximum flexibility for business logic.\n\nYou would be able to achieve exactly your desired semantics in Kafka if you don't rely on topic-partitions to maintain ordering of your groups, but if each group gets its own topic (with a single partition). But this might not be a good idea if you have *many* groups, as this could be a lot of metadata for the brokers to track.

  "communityName": "r/artificial",
  "parsedCommunityName": "artificial",
  "body": "The FullDiT paper introduces a novel multi-task video foundation model with full spatiotemporal attention, which is a significant departure from previous models that process videos frame-by-frame. Instead of breaking down videos into individual frames, FullDiT processes entire video sequences simultaneously, enabling better temporal consistency and coherence.\n\nKey technical highlights:\n- **Full spatiotemporal attention**: Each token attends to all other tokens across both space and time dimensions\n- **Hierarchical attention mechanism**: Uses spatial, temporal, and hybrid attention components to balance computational efficiency and performance\n- **Multi-task capabilities**: Single model architecture handles text-to-video, image-to-video, and video inpainting without task-specific modifications\n- **Training strategy**: Combines synthetic data (created from text-to-image models plus motion synthesis) with real video data\n- **State-of-the-art results**: Achieves leading performance across multiple benchmarks while maintaining better temporal consistency\n\nI think this approach represents an important shift in how we approach video generation. The frame-by-frame paradigm has been dominant due to computational constraints, but it fundamentally limits temporal consistency. By treating videos as true 4D data (space + time) rather than sequences of images, we can potentially achieve more coherent and realistic results.\n\nThe multi-task nature is equally important - instead of having specialized models for each video task, a single foundation model can handle diverse applications. This suggests we're moving toward more general video AI systems that can be fine-tuned or prompted for specific purposes rather than built from scratch.\n\nThe computational demands remain a challenge, though. Even with the hierarchical optimizations, processing full videos simultaneously is resource-intensive. But as hardware improves, I expect we'll see these techniques scale to longer and higher-resolution video generation.\n\n**TLDR**: FullDiT introduces full spatiotemporal attention for video generation, processing entire sequences simultaneously rather than frame-by-frame. This results in better temporal consistency across text-to-video, image-to-video, and video inpainting tasks, pointing toward more unified approaches to video AI.\n\n[Full summary is here](https://aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/fulldit-multi-task-video-generative-foundation-model). Paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19907).",
  "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FullDiT paper introduces a novel multi-task video foundation model with full spatiotemporal attention, which is a significant departure from previous models that process videos frame-by-frame. Instead of breaking down videos into individual frames, FullDiT processes entire video sequences simultaneously, enabling better temporal consistency and coherence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Key technical highlights:\n- &lt;strong&gt;Full spatiotemporal attention&lt;/strong&gt;: Each token attends to all other tokens across both space and time dimensions\n- &lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical attention mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: Uses spatial, temporal, and hybrid attention components to balance computational efficiency and performance\n- &lt;strong&gt;Multi-task capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Single model architecture handles text-to-video, image-to-video, and video inpainting without task-specific modifications\n- &lt;strong&gt;Training strategy&lt;/strong&gt;: Combines synthetic data (created from text-to-image models plus motion synthesis) with real video data\n- &lt;strong&gt;State-of-the-art results&lt;/strong&gt;: Achieves leading performance across multiple benchmarks while maintaining better temporal consistency&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this approach represents an important shift in how we approach video generation. The frame-by-frame paradigm has been dominant due to computational constraints, but it fundamentally limits temporal consistency. By treating videos as true 4D data (space + time) rather than sequences of images, we can potentially achieve more coherent and realistic results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The multi-task nature is equally important - instead of having specialized models for each video task, a single foundation model can handle diverse applications.

That said, I do worry about this one getting overtaken by AI. What is threat hunting if not sifting through massive amounts of data and looking for anomalies, after all.

Seems like a pretty in-demand field and I really like the fact that the skills are so transferrable. You learn AWS security, you're an asset to any company that uses AWS.

Your \"important items\" could literally be at least 3-4 different roles, so you need to prioritize them more and decide what's most important...second most...third most...etc.",

  "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the best path for you is going to be some kind of Security Engineering role that also wears an architecture hat. Red teaming certainly fits your background, but maybe not all of your &amp;quot;important items.&amp;quot; You could even try to dabble in something like a DevSecOps role since you have a relevant background and a desire to move into a major tech company, which would definitely leverage those skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I see you having is you have many interests that might not all be possible in a single role, especially if you are in or move into a massive tech company. Your &amp;quot;important items&amp;quot; could literally be at least 3-4 different roles, so you need to prioritize them more and decide what&amp;#39;s most important...second most...third most...etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On the other hand I'm a bit worried that theres not a huge demand for red teamers in most companies and if the job market stays as it is right now, even lots of experience and certs won't help me if I need to change jobs at some point.",

  "body": "Hey, I started out in appsec and moved into offensive security/red teaming. I‚Äôve been doing it for over ten years now. Pretty much at the biggest companies you‚Äôd know. I‚Äôll caution you that it is a mentally taxing job. It requires you to consistently learn new things, stay up to date with the latest attacks, and requires you to get really specialized and deep in something or be a generalist who knows a lot to hack the things. If pentesting already feels dull, it may not be the route to go.\n\nWith that said, it is extremely lucrative. There aren‚Äôt many roles like you said, and it‚Äôs a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem when it comes to breaking into red teaming. You kind of need someone to bring you into the fold or demonstrate extreme ownership by building tools or finding new bugs. You also do want to find a mentor when you‚Äôre starting because it‚Äôs really easy to make production outage mistakes for newbies or incur legal headaches.¬†\n\nI want to paint you a little bit of the negative because I think people do see it as the sexiest, most fun part of security. It is. I love it and what I do, but sometimes, man, it‚Äôs tough. I also consistently need to justify why my engagements take so long. Everyone loves my readouts, and I make people‚Äôs blood drain out of their face, but I‚Äôm constantly told, ‚ÄúGotta be faster, gotta do more.‚Äù Some people really don‚Äôt appreciate how long it takes to uncover a good hack or attack chain. It‚Äôs an art to me.¬†\n\nYour quality of life depends on having a good relationship with the blue team too. I‚Äôve had blue teamers who understand I‚Äôm here to help them and love hunting me and then others that groan at the thought of, oh god it‚Äôs just the red team we can ignore them. Those ones suck cause sometimes I spent months putting it together for them and was really creative and it deflates you.\n\nI think based on what you‚Äôve said, do threat hunting and build some emulation frameworks to test your detections or assumptions. Look into building out deception campaigns and honeypots. You can learn some reverse engineering, understand how adversaries think and their motivations. Which is more interesting than just pentesting and learning an LFI or another XSS. A good threat hunter is what you want when real shit hits the fan, and will always be needed. When a company has been breached, they‚Äôll pay you whatever to diagnose and fix the problem.¬†\n\nThat said, I‚Äôm a random person on the internet, you need to be your own person and sit down and think about the type of person you are and what type of role will fulfill you within your life. How hard do you want to work and are you ok with where this may take you in 5 years.

After our biotech lab purchases this software, I began learning it even when on to get a MS in information systems. To me this was the standard of how documentation should be. Simple enough for a novice to understand but with enough information for advanced users to continue to reference the documentation. Believe or not I found it on the internet archive. &lt;a href=\"https://archive.org/details/paradox-3.0-users-guide/mode/2up\"&gt;Paradox 3.0 Users Guide : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

If you don't know a thing and take longer than you \"should\" to get it done, or even have to ask for help, what's the worst that can happen? Is someone gonna die? Will the company go under? Nah.

I now associate that feeling with growth, pushing my limits, learning and improving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also helps to give yourself perspective. If you don&amp;#39;t know a thing and take longer than you &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; to get it done, or even have to ask for help, what&amp;#39;s the worst that can happen? Is someone gonna die? Will the company go under? Nah. Almost nothing will happen; maybe you&amp;#39;ll get reprimanded, more likely nobody will remember but you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all just a big game. Nothing is as important as it seems, and nobody actually knows what&amp;#39;s going on. Just do your best, take responsibility for your mistakes and keep getting better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

(If you browse this subreddit, you'll see two common themes: DevOps is typically a senior-level role that comes after other engineering roles, and DevOps is more of a \"philosophy\" than a job title‚Äîbut that‚Äôs a discussion for another day.)\n\nI‚Äôm not sure where you're located, but in the U.S., the tech job market is extremely competitive, with experienced engineers filling most openings, making it hard for a newbie to stand out. While I do see my students land DevOps roles as newcomers, it‚Äôs almost never just through applying‚Äîit happens because someone in their network opens the door for them. Be prepared to send out hundreds of applications with little response, but more importantly, focus on networking. Connections are the key factor in getting hired at this newbie stage. It‚Äôs a tough path, but if you put in the work and build the right relationships, you can eventually break in. Once you've been in DevOps for a few years (especially if you're at a big company, things are much different, and you'll get recruiters reaching out all of the time)\n\nThat said, if you're outside the U.S., the landscape may be very different. DevOps skills are in high demand in many places, and competition may not be as intense.",

  "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt want to discourage you, but breaking into DevOps as a newbie is a serious challenge. (If you browse this subreddit, you&amp;#39;ll see two common themes: DevOps is typically a senior-level role that comes after other engineering roles, and DevOps is more of a &amp;quot;philosophy&amp;quot; than a job title‚Äîbut that‚Äôs a discussion for another day.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure where you&amp;#39;re located, but in the U.S., the tech job market is extremely competitive, with experienced engineers filling most openings, making it hard for a newbie to stand out. While I do see my students land DevOps roles as newcomers, it‚Äôs almost never just through applying‚Äîit happens because someone in their network opens the door for them. Be prepared to send out hundreds of applications with little response, but more importantly, focus on networking. Connections are the key factor in getting hired at this newbie stage. It‚Äôs a tough path, but if you put in the work and build the right relationships, you can eventually break in. Once you&amp;#39;ve been in DevOps for a few years (especially if you&amp;#39;re at a big company, things are much different, and you&amp;#39;ll get recruiters reaching out all of the time)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, if you&amp;#39;re outside the U.S., the landscape may be very different. DevOps skills are in high demand in many places, and competition may not be as intense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

  "title": "Pomerium Now with OpenTelemetry Tracing for Every Request in v0.29.0",
  "communityName": "r/devops",
  "parsedCommunityName": "devops",
  "body": "Hey /r/devops\\! I am one of the maintainers of Pomerium. If you haven't run into it, Pomerium ([https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium))  is our open-source identity-aware access proxy ‚Äì basically, a reverse proxy handles SSO (authentication) and enforces access policies based on identity and context (authorization) continuously for your internal services. Think BeyondCorp, but something you can run yourself.\n\nBeing that gateway means Pomerium sees *every* request coming into your protected services, handling the authN/Z flow. This makes it a pretty logical spot to generate telemetry.\n\nSo, in our latest release ([v0.29.0, just dropped](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/announcing-pomerium-v0290)), we've added **distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry**. Pomerium now spits out standard OTel traces for the entire request lifecycle ‚Äì from when it first hits Pomerium, through all the auth checks, policy enforcement, and finally proxying to your upstream app.\n\nWhy the change? We used to have separate integrations for Jaeger, Datadog, Zipkin, etc. Frankly, maintaining all those bespoke clients was a pain, both for us and for users. Moving to OpenTelemetry means **one standard way to configure tracing** (OTLP) that works with **any OTel-compatible backend** (Jaeger, Tempo, Honeycomb, you name it). No more vendor-specific settings in Pomerium's config or code. Just point Pomerium at your collector using the standard OTel env vars, and you're good to go. It makes plugging Pomerium into your existing observability stack *much* simpler.\n\n**In short, that‚Äôs meant we‚Äôve been able to:**\n\n* **See inside the proxy:** You get traces spanning all of Pomerium's own services (Proxy, Authenticate, Authorize). This helps you figure out *exactly* where time is being spent or where errors are happening *within* the access flow itself. Is it the IdP redirect? The policy check? The upstream connection? Now you can see it.  \n* **Standard OTel Integration (Finally\\!):** Configure tracing using the environment variables you likely already use for other services (`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, etc.). Point it at your collector, choose your sampler (`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`), done. No more maintaining separate configs for Jaeger vs. Datadog vs. whatever comes next. Configure once, send anywhere. (Big relief for us maintainers too\\!)  \n* **Easier Auth Debugging:** This is a big one. The traces now show the *entire* authentication flow, including redirects to your IdP and back. If something breaks (like a typo in your OIDC issuer URL ‚Äì happens to the best of us), you'll see an error span right in the trace explaining the problem, instead of just a generic error page for the user and log-digging for you.  \n* **Trace the Login Journey:** Following on the above, you can visualize the whole multi-hop login process. See the sequence: User hits app \\-\\&gt; Pomerium redirects \\-\\&gt; IdP login \\-\\&gt; Callback \\-\\&gt; Pomerium checks policy \\-\\&gt; Proxy to app. Each step is a span. Super useful for understanding why a login might feel slow or figuring out where a complex flow is failing.  \n* **Connect Edge Traces to Backend Traces:** Because Pomerium forwards the standard trace context headers (like `traceparent`), its spans automatically link up with traces generated by your upstream applications (assuming they're also instrumented with OTel). We tested this with Grafana ‚Äì enable OTel in both, and Jaeger shows one unified trace: Pomerium's auth spans followed by Grafana's page-load spans. This end-to-end view across the proxy boundary is gold for troubleshooting.  \n* **Simple Setup, Flexible Control:** Tracing is off by default (no perf hit unless you want it). To turn it on, just set those standard OTel env vars. You control the sampling rate (`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=1.0` for everything, `0.1` for 10%, etc.) to balance detail vs. overhead/cost, just like your other services.\n\n\nHopefully, that gives you a good sense of what's new. If you want the nitty-gritty config details and more examples, check out the official [tracing docs](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/tracing). The full [**v0.29.0 release blog post**](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/announcing-pomerium-v0290) has more context too (just technical stuff, no fluff).\n\n**Now, I'd love to hear from this community:** How are you folks using tracing &amp; OTel in similar spots?\n\n* Anyone tracing your **auth layers** (custom auth services, other proxies, API gateways)? What have you learned? Any implementation gotchas / tips / you‚Äôd like solved?  \n* Are you doing tracing **across your ingress/proxy layer and into your backend apps**? How's correlating those traces working out? Any gotchas?  \n* What observability gaps do you still see around **authentication, authorization, or edge access**? What do you *wish* you could trace better?\n\nLooking forward to the discussion\\! Happy to answer any questions about how we implemented this in Pomerium too. \n\nCheers\\!",
